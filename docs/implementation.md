## 1. Project Overview

This project implements a **k-of-n Multisig Wallet** contract that:
- Requires \( k \) valid signatures out of \( n \) signers to authorize a transaction.
- Allows the current set of \( n \) signers to update the signer set and threshold.
- Validates signatures on-chain with a robust approach (nonce management, domain separation, etc.).
- Is written in Solidity (though the pattern can be adapted to other blockchains).

**Use Case**: Securely manage on-chain assets or arbitrarily call external contracts under the approval of multiple signers.

**Primary Goals**:
1. **Security**: Resist replay attacks, signature malleability, reentrancy, and attempts to update the signer set maliciously.  
2. **Simplicity**: Keep the contract easy to understand and audit, minimizing complexity.  
3. **Extendibility**: Provide a clear path to add advanced features (e.g., time locks, daily limits) if needed in the future.

---

## 2. Technical Requirements

1. **Language/Chain**: Solidity (EVM-compatible).  
2. **Signature Verification**: Off-chain signature creation using ECDSA; on-chain verification via `ecrecover` or OpenZeppelin `ECDSA` library.  
3. **Threshold**: \(\text{k-of-n}\) signers required for a valid transaction.  
4. **Nonce Management**: Single global nonce for all transactions and updates (or separate nonces for governance vs. execution, if desired).  
5. **Updating Signers**:
   - Must also require \( k \) valid signatures from the **current** signers.  
   - New threshold must be within \([1, \text{newNumberOfSigners}]\).  
6. **Replay Protection**:
   - Embed `chainid` and contract address in the message hash.  
   - Use an increment-only nonce.  

**Environment**:  
- **Compiler**: `solc >= 0.8.x` (for built-in overflow checks).  
- **Tooling**: Hardhat or Foundry for compilation, testing, and deployment scripts (whichever you prefer).

## 3. System Architecture

### 3.1 Contract Structure

**MultisigWallet.sol** (Primary Contract)  
- **Storage**:
  - `mapping(address => bool) public isSigner;`
  - `uint256 public threshold;`
  - `uint256 public nonce;`
  - Optionally, an array `address[] public signersList;` to track signers for iteration/logging.
- **Constructor**:
  - Accepts `_initialSigners` and `_initialThreshold`.
  - Sets up `isSigner[address] = true` for each signer, ensures \(`1 <= threshold <= _initialSigners.length`\).
  - Initializes `nonce = 0`.
- **Functions**:
  1. `executeTransaction(address to, uint256 value, bytes calldata data, uint256 _nonce, bytes[] calldata signatures)`
     - Verifies `_nonce == nonce`, increments `nonce++`, checks at least `k` valid signatures from unique signers.
     - Executes the call via `to.call{value: value}(data)`.
  2. `updateSigners(address[] calldata newSigners, uint256 newThreshold, uint256 _nonce, bytes[] calldata signatures)`
     - Similar signature check but encodes domain data indicating an “update signer set” action.
     - Updates `isSigner[...]` mappings, sets `threshold = newThreshold`.
     - Increments `nonce`.
  3. `getMessageHash(...)` / `getSignerUpdateHash(...)`
     - Encodes `(chainid, address(this), to, data, nonce, …)` to ensure domain separation.
  4. `recoverSigner(...)`
     - Uses `ECDSA.recover` or `ecrecover` to get the signer address from the signature.

### 3.2 External Scripts / Off-Chain Coordination

A minimal script or off-chain tool can:
- Generate the transaction data (`to, value, data, nonce`).
- Prompt signers to sign this data.
- Collect signatures and submit them in a single transaction to `MultisigWallet.executeTransaction(...)`.

## 4. Development Environment Setup

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Node.js (>= 16.0.0)  
   - NPM or Yarn  
   - Hardhat or Foundry installed globally (optional).
2. **Repository Structure** (example):
   ```
   multisig-wallet/
   ├─ contracts/
   │   └─ MultisigWallet.sol
   ├─ scripts/
   │   ├─ deploy.js (or deploy.ts)
   │   └─ signTransaction.js (off-chain signing helper)
   ├─ test/
   │   ├─ multisig.test.js (or multisig.spec.ts)
   │   └─ ...
   ├─ .gitignore

   ├─ README.md
   └─ hardhat.config.js (or foundry.toml)
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies**:
   - For Hardhat (example):
     ```bash
     npm init -y
     npm install --save-dev hardhat @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers ethers chai mocha
     npx hardhat
     ```
   - For Foundry:
     ```bash
     curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
     foundryup
     forge init
     # Then place the contracts and tests accordingly
     ```

4. **Configuration**:
   - Configure `hardhat.config.js` or `foundry.toml` with compiler version (`0.8.x`), network settings, etc.

---

## 5. Implementation Outline

Below is the **step-by-step** approach to building the contract.

### 5.1 Create the `MultisigWallet.sol` Contract
- **Step 1**: Define storage:  
  ```solidity
  mapping(address => bool) public isSigner;
  uint256 public threshold;
  uint256 public nonce;
  ```
- **Step 2**: Implement constructor:
  - Validate `threshold <= signers.length && threshold > 0`.
  - Populate `isSigner[signer] = true` for each initial signer.
  - Set `nonce = 0`.
- **Step 3**: Add `getMessageHash` and `recoverSigner` helpers.
  - Consider domain separation with chain ID and contract address.
  - For personal_sign style, use OpenZeppelin’s `ECDSA.toEthSignedMessageHash`; or for EIP-712, define a typed data domain.
- **Step 4**: Implement `executeTransaction`.
  - Check `require(_nonce == nonce)`.
  - For each signature, recover the signer; ensure `isSigner[signer]` is true, track duplicates.
  - Check `validSignaturesCount >= threshold`.
  - `nonce++`.
  - `(bool success, ) = _to.call{value: _value}(_data); require(success, "Call failed");`
- **Step 5**: Implement `updateSigners`.
  - Essentially the same signature check but for new signers array and new threshold.
  - Clear old signers or update them, set `threshold = newThreshold`.
  - `nonce++`.

### 5.2 Write Deployment Script
- In `scripts/deploy.js` (Hardhat example):
  ```js
  const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

  async function main() {
    const [deployer] = await ethers.getSigners();
    const MultisigWallet = await ethers.getContractFactory("MultisigWallet", deployer);

    const initialSigners = ["0x...", "0x...", ...];
    const initialThreshold = 2;

    const wallet = await MultisigWallet.deploy(initialSigners, initialThreshold);
    await wallet.deployed();

    console.log("MultisigWallet deployed at:", wallet.address);
  }

  main().catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
  });
  ```

### 5.3 Off-Chain Signing Script (Optional Example)
- In `scripts/signTransaction.js`, you might:
  - Prompt user for `_to, _value, _data, _nonce`.
  - Create a hash using the same logic as contract’s `getMessageHash`.
  - Sign with a private key using `ethers.utils.signMessage(hash)` or EIP-712 typed data.
  - Save the signatures to JSON for submission.

## 6. Testing Strategy & Comprehensive Test Suite

This section outlines **all** recommended tests, organized in a structured manner. See the [full, expanded test list](#) for details.

1. **Initialization Tests**  
   - Valid constructor params; invalid threshold or duplicate signers revert.
2. **Signature Verification Tests**  
   - Valid vs. invalid signatures, malleable `s` checks.
3. **Nonce Handling**  
   - Ensure nonce increments only on success, doesn’t increment on revert.
4. **Threshold Logic**  
   - Test exactly k signatures, fewer than k, and more than k.
5. **Signer Update Mechanics**  
   - Valid update with k signers, invalid update with fewer signers, threshold checks.
6. **Integration Tests**  
   - Full “happy path” flows: gather signatures, call `executeTransaction`, verify side effects.
   - Replay attempts on old nonces must fail.
7. **Edge Cases**  
   - Threshold = 1, threshold = n, zero data, self-call, removing signers until 1 left, etc.
8. **Security-Focused**  
   - Re-entrancy attempts, gas spamming, cross-chain replay with chain ID checks.
9. **(If cross-chain is relevant)**  
   - Attempt bridging or simulating different chain IDs to ensure no replay across multiple chains.

**Location**: Place test files in `test/MultisigWallet.test.js` (or `.spec.ts` if using TypeScript) with descriptive test cases reflecting the items above.

## 7. Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

### 7.1 Planning & Requirements
- Finalize the **k-of-n** scope: how big can n be? Will we need advanced features like time locks or daily limits?  
- Decide if we store signers as a `mapping` or an array.  
- Confirm cross-chain requirements or domain separation approach.

### 7.2 Design
- Outline your data structures, function signatures, and security requirements (nonce, chain ID, etc.).  
- Optionally produce a simple UML diagram or state diagram for the update flow and the transaction flow.

### 7.3 Implementation
- Write and commit the initial `MultisigWallet.sol` with a stub for each function.  
- Implement each function in small increments, commit frequently.

### 7.4 Testing (Continuous)
- As soon as each function is implemented, add or run the relevant unit tests.  
- Maintain a robust test suite in `test/`.  
- Optionally, run fuzz testing with tools like `Echidna` or Foundry’s built-in fuzzing.

### 7.5 Peer Review / Self-Review
- Since you’re solo, consider:
  - Reading the code thoroughly at each step for logic errors.  
  - Using static analysis (e.g., Slither, MythX) for automated checks.

### 7.6 Staging & Deployment
- Deploy on a local dev chain (Hardhat/Foundry) for final integration tests.  
- Migrate to a testnet (e.g., Goerli/Polygon Mumbai).  
- Validate all tests pass in the testnet environment, performing an end-to-end transaction.

### 7.7 Maintenance
- Track updates to the EVM, compiler, or external library (OpenZeppelin) for relevant security patches.  
- Over time, you might integrate advanced features (modules) if requirements grow.

---

## 8. Future Extensions & Maintenance

1. **Time Lock**  
   - Add a module or extension that enforces a 24-hour delay after k-of-n approval before final execution. Good for large treasuries.

2. **Spending Limits**  
   - Implement daily or per-transaction caps on how many tokens can be moved with partial vs. full threshold signers.

3. **Cross-Chain**  
   - If bridging or controlling assets across multiple L2s or sidechains, ensure the domain separator includes chain ID. Possibly replicate the same contract logic on each chain.

4. **Upgradeability**  
   - If you anticipate evolving the contract, consider a proxy architecture (like OpenZeppelin Upgradeable contracts). But be cautious: upgradeability can introduce new governance and security complexities.

5. **Audits**  
   - If the contract will manage significant assets, plan for an external audit from a reputable firm or open-source community audits.
