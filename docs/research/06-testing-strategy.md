Below is **Topic #6** in our series: **Testing Strategies and Scenarios**. We’ll outline a structured testing approach that covers both the functional and security-critical aspects of a k-of-n multisig, ensuring robust coverage against potential real-world usage (and abuse).

## 6. Testing Strategies and Scenarios

### 6.1 Overview of Testing Philosophy

A comprehensive test plan for a security-critical smart contract like a multisig should include:

1. **Unit Tests**:  
   - Verify correctness of individual functions (e.g., signature verification, nonce increment, threshold logic).  
   - Use both “happy path” and “error path” tests.

2. **Integration Tests**:  
   - Test end-to-end flows (e.g., off-chain signature creation, on-chain submission, state updates).  
   - Consider real-world flows in which signers interact with UI or off-chain tools.

3. **Edge-Case & Boundary Condition Tests**:  
   - Explore scenarios at or beyond normal design limits (e.g., threshold = numberOfSigners, threshold = 1, etc.).  
   - Stress test with multiple calls in quick succession.

4. **Fuzz Testing**:  
   - Random inputs to uncover corner cases or unexpected reverts.  
   - Potentially combine with property-based testing (e.g., no transaction can execute if fewer than k signers have signed).

5. **Security-Focused Tests**:  
   - Attempt re-entrancy, replay attacks, or signature malleability.  
   - Check for resource exhaustion (gas denial-of-service).

6. **Cross-Chain / Integration Tests** (if relevant):  
   - If bridging is part of the design, simulate bridging delays, chain re-orgs, or invalid bridging messages.

Below, we give a more detailed breakdown, including example test scenarios. While these tests are framed in an EVM/Solidity context, the same logic applies to other blockchains with minimal adjustments.

### 6.2 Unit Tests

1. **Initialization Tests**  
   - **`testConstructorValidParams`**: Supply valid signers in the constructor and check that state is correctly initialized (signers, threshold, nonce).  
   - **`testConstructorInvalidThreshold`**: Provide a threshold of 0 or threshold > number of signers—expect revert.

2. **Signature Verification Tests**  
   - **`testRecoverSignerValidSignature`**: Verify that a correct signature recovers to the expected address.  
   - **`testRecoverSignerInvalidSignature`**: Provide a malformed signature, expect it to revert or recover an address not in the signer set.

3. **Nonce Handling**  
   - **`testInitialNonce`**: Ensure it starts at 0.  
   - **`testIncrementNonceOnSuccess`**: Call `executeTransaction` with valid signatures and verify that nonce increments exactly by 1.  
   - **`testNonceDoesNotIncrementOnFailure`**: Provide invalid signatures or threshold. Expect revert and ensure nonce remains unchanged.

4. **Threshold Logic**  
   - **`testExactNumberOfSignatures`**: Provide exactly k valid signatures; transaction should succeed.  
   - **`testInsufficientSignatures`**: Provide k-1 signatures; expect revert.  
   - **`testExcessSignatures`**: Provide more than k valid signatures; should still succeed.

5. **Signer Update Mechanics**  
   - **`testUpdateSignersValid`**: Gather k signatures from current signers, update to a new set. Ensure the new set is now recognized by the contract.  
   - **`testUpdateSignersInvalidThreshold`**: Attempt to set a threshold of 0 or above the number of new signers; expect revert.  
   - **`testUpdateSignersInsufficientApprovals`**: Provide < k valid signatures for the update; expect revert.

6. **Duplicate Signer Checks**  
   - **`testDuplicateSignaturesFromSameSigner`**: Provide multiple signatures from the same signer. Should only be counted once in the total.  
   - **`testDuplicateAddressesInNewSignersSet`**: If your contract disallows duplicates in the new set, confirm it reverts or handles it properly.

---

### 6.3 Integration Tests (End-to-End)

1. **Happy Path Transaction Execution**  
   - **Scenario**:  
     1. Off-chain aggregator obtains valid signatures from exactly k signers.  
     2. Submits them on-chain to `executeTransaction`.  
     3. Checks the contract called `_to` with `_value` and `_data`.  
   - **Verification**:  
     - Nonce increments.  
     - Balance or state in `_to` is updated (if relevant).  
     - An `event TransactionExecuted` is emitted (if implemented).

2. **Replay Attack Attempt**  
   - **Scenario**:  
     1. Execute a transaction successfully (nonce goes from 0 to 1).  
     2. Try to replay the same signatures with the old nonce = 0.  
   - **Verification**:  
     - Must revert with “Invalid nonce.”  
     - Nonce is unchanged from the last valid execution.

3. **Parallel Transaction Race**  
   - **Scenario**:  
     1. Two different transactions are signed with the same nonce = 0.  
     2. Submit them in quick succession on the same block or across two blocks.  
   - **Verification**:  
     - Only the first submission that hits the chain and is mined will succeed.  
     - The second submission reverts with “Invalid nonce.”  
     - Nonce ends up at 1 afterward.

4. **Signer Update Then Transaction**  
   - **Scenario**:  
     1. Update signers (off-chain gather k approvals from old set, execute on-chain).  
     2. Immediately attempt a transaction using signatures from the new signers.  
   - **Verification**:  
     - The old signers (removed) are no longer recognized.  
     - The new signers are recognized and can produce a valid transaction for the next nonce.

5. **Complex Transaction Data**  
   - **Scenario**:  
     1. Use `executeTransaction` to call a function on another contract that modifies state or triggers events.  
     2. Possibly chain calls, re-entrancy checks, or calls to self.  
   - **Verification**:  
     - The entire call sequence works as expected.  
     - Re-entrancy guard or checks don’t cause incorrect reverts.

### 6.4 Edge-Case and Boundary Tests

1. **Single-Signature Threshold (k=1)**  
   - Ensure that if threshold = 1, any recognized signer alone can execute transactions.  
   - Test removing or adding that signer.

2. **Threshold = Number of Signers (k=n)**  
   - Ensure that all signers must sign for a transaction to pass.  
   - Attempt a transaction with n-1 signatures, expect revert.

3. **Zero-Value / Zero-Data Transaction**  
   - Call `_to` with `_value = 0` and empty `_data`; check it still increments nonce if the threshold is met.  
   - This scenario ensures no hidden assumptions about transferring funds.

4. **Self-Call**  
   - If `_to = address(this)`, test that re-entrancy or recursive calls do not break the logic.  
   - Possibly a scenario where the multisig calls its own `executeTransaction` function is forced to revert (to avoid indefinite recursion).

5. **Signer Replacement Attack Simulation**  
   - A multi-step scenario:  
     1. Repeatedly remove one honest signer and add a malicious one, each time requiring k signatures.  
     2. Eventually, the malicious signers outnumber the honest.  
   - **Verification**:  
     - This test ensures that partial infiltration requires multiple steps, each requiring threshold agreement.  
     - Demonstrates that an attacker can’t do it in a single step if they only control fewer than k signers.

### 6.5 Security-Focused and Fuzz Testing

1. **Malleability Test**  
   - If using raw ECDSA, test variations of `(v, r, s)` to ensure the contract logic consistently recovers the same address.  
   - Provide an intentionally malleated signature to see if it’s incorrectly accepted.

2. **Fuzz Test**  
   - Randomize values for `_to, _value, _data, _nonce`, and generate random signatures to see if any revert conditions or corner cases pop up unexpectedly.

3. **Re-entrancy**  
   - In an integration environment, craft a malicious contract that calls back into the multisig upon receiving a call.  
   - Confirm that the multisig has already incremented the nonce or otherwise blocks re-entrant calls.

4. **DoS / Gas Exhaustion**  
   - Submit a transaction with maximum possible signatures (equal to or greater than n).  
   - Confirm the contract handles the loop gracefully, or reverts if it hits the block gas limit.  
   - If needed, optimize signature verification or impose a maximum n.

5. **Cross-Chain Replay** (If relevant)  
   - Attempt to replay the same signature on a different chain ID if you have a test environment with multiple chain IDs.  
   - Expect that the domain separation (`block.chainid` in the hash) makes it invalid.

### 6.6 Cross-Chain Tests (If Applicable)

If the multisig is integrated with Axelar or another interoperability layer:

1. **Bridged Governance**  
   - Simulate an update to signers on Chain A that must be replicated to Chain B.  
   - Check that a malicious bridging message (not signed by k-of-n signers) is rejected.

2. **Delayed Finality**  
   - On some chains, finality is not immediate. Test that your system can handle or wait for final confirmations before executing cross-chain updates.

3. **Fork / Reorg**  
   - On test networks, artificially force a chain reorg. See if pending transactions or bridging messages are replayed incorrectly.  
   - This may require specialized local testnet tooling but is critical for high-value cross-chain systems.

### 6.7 Combining Tests in a Pipeline

In practice, you’d set up:

1. **Local Tests** (e.g., with Hardhat or Foundry in the Ethereum ecosystem) for unit + integration.  
2. **Testnet Deployment** to a public test network (e.g., Goerli, Polygon Mumbai, etc.), replicating cross-chain bridging if needed.  
3. **Security Review / Audit** with specialized security engineers or external firms.  
4. **Production Monitoring** once deployed, using watchers or on-chain analytics (e.g., checking for unusual calls).

### 6.8 Conclusion of Topic #6

A **rigorous testing strategy** is key to ensuring that the k-of-n multisig functions correctly under normal conditions and remains robust against malicious attempts. By covering everything from straightforward unit tests (e.g., threshold checks, nonce increments) to complex adversarial simulations (e.g., re-entrancy, bridging exploits), we reduce the risk of critical vulnerabilities slipping through to production.

**Next**: We’ll move into **Topic #7: Alternative Approaches and Tradeoffs**, where we revisit advanced or less-common multisig designs (threshold cryptography, social recovery, role-based weighting) and how they compare to the baseline approach we’ve covered so far.
